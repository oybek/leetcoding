# LeetCode

- `51 N-Queens` **Backtracking**
- `52 N-Queens 2` **Backtracking**
- `1222. Queens That Can Attack the King` **Bruteforce**
- `327. Count of Range Sum` **?**
- `67. Add Binary` **Implementation**

# Meanings

**Implementation** - is kind of solution when you program straight forward
what is described in problem statement.

**Backtracking** - is subtype of **try em all** approach where recursive function
used.

**Bruteforce** - another kind of **try em all** method without using recursion

**Divide N Conqueror** - kind of approaches, when the problem is splitted into
smaller ones, each subproblem is solved separately and the results are merged to
final result

**Memoization** - technique when you save result of some long computation into
cache, in future to reuse it, instead of extra calculation
